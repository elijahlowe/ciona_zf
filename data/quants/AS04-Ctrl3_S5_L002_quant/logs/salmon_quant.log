[2019-09-23 16:09:18.599] [jointLog] [info] Usage of --validateMappings implies use of minScoreFraction. Since not explicitly specified, it is being set to 0.65
[2019-09-23 16:09:18.599] [jointLog] [info] Usage of --validateMappings, without --hardFilter implies use of range factorization. rangeFactorizationBins is being set to 4
[2019-09-23 16:09:18.599] [jointLog] [info] Usage of --validateMappings implies a default consensus slack of 0.2. Setting consensusSlack to 0.2.
